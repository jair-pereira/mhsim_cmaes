# Re-evaluating Algorithm Variations using Empirical Similarity
This repository contains the code, data, and additional figures for our GECCO 2023 poster.

In our paper, we analyze two ways to compare metaheuristic search algorithms: Component Similarity and Performance Similarity. To do so, we use these similarity metrics on 9 CMA-ES variants on the COCO Benchmark.
